### Understanding the Problem
You have a Folder class that:

Has a name

Can contain files (as an array of strings)

Can have up to two subfolders (folder1, folder2)

You need to write a function that:

Checks if a file exists in this folder or any of its subfolders.

Returns the path to the file (e.g., "home/folderA/file1").

```swift
class Folder {
    var name: String
    var files: [String]?
    var folder1: Folder?
    var folder2: Folder?
    
    init(name: String, files: [String]? = nil, folder1: Folder? = nil, folder2: Folder? = nil) {
        self.name = name
        self.files = files
        self.folder1 = folder1
        self.folder2 = folder2
    }
    
    func findFile(_ fileName: String, currentPath: String = "") -> String? {
        let path = currentPath.isEmpty ? name : "\(currentPath)/\(name)"
        
        // Check if the file is in the current folder
        if let files = files, files.contains(fileName) {
            return "\(path)/\(fileName)"
        }
        
        // Recursively search in subfolders
        if let foundPath = folder1?.findFile(fileName, currentPath: path) {
            return foundPath
        }
        
        if let foundPath = folder2?.findFile(fileName, currentPath: path) {
            return foundPath
        }
        
        return nil // File not found
    }
}

// Example Usage
let subFolderA = Folder(name: "Documents", files: ["resume.pdf", "notes.txt"])
let subFolderB = Folder(name: "Photos", files: ["image1.jpg", "image2.png"])
let rootFolder = Folder(name: "Home", files: ["config.json"], folder1: subFolderA, folder2: subFolderB)

if let filePath = rootFolder.findFile("notes.txt") {
    print("File found at path: \(filePath)")
} else {
    print("File not found")
}
```

How to Approach This in an Interview
Clarify the Requirements

Should the search be case-sensitive?

Can folders have more than two subfolders? (If yes, use an array instead of folder1 & folder2)

Should we return all paths if there are multiple files with the same name?

Explain Your Thought Process

Use recursion to explore folders.

Maintain the path as you go deeper.

Return the first match or handle multiple occurrences.

Discuss Edge Cases

What if the folder is empty?

What if there are no files at all?

What if multiple files have the same name?

Can folder names contain spaces or special characters?

Optimize If Needed

If the folder structure is very deep, recursion could lead to a stack overflow. Using an iterative approach with a stack (DFS) would be better.
